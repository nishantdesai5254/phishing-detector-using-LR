# phishing-detector-using-LR

### Background of Problem Statement :

You are expected to write the code for a binary classification model (phishing website or not) using Python Scikit-Learn that trains on the data and calculates the accuracy score on the test data. You have to use one or more of the classification algorithms to train a model on the phishing website dataset.

# Questions that have solved in above module:

Questions to be answered with analysis :

Write the code for a binary classification model (phishing website or not) using Python Scikit-Learn that trains on the data and calculates the accuracy score on the test data.
Use one or more of the classification algorithms to train a model on the phishing website dataset.
Analysis Tasks to be performed:

Initiation :
Begin by creating a new ipynb file and load the dataset in it.



*Exercise 1 :
Build a phishing website classifier using Logistic Regression with “C” parameter = 100. 
Use 70% of data as training data and the remaining 30% as test data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Print count of misclassified samples in the test data prediction as well as the accuracy score of the model. 
 

*Exercise 2 :
Train with only two input parameters - parameter Prefix_Suffix and 13 URL_of_Anchor.
Check accuracy using the test data and compare the accuracy with the previous value.
Plot the test samples along with the decision boundary when trained with index 5 and index 13 parameters.
